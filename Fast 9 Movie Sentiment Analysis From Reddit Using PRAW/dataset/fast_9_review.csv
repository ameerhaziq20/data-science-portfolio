"If you’re ever falling to your death try land on a car. It will break your fall but not your back. 

Apparently",2021-06-25 02:24:48
Hellen Mirren saying John Cena and Vin Diesel have similar facial features with a straight face was the highlight of the movie,2021-06-25 06:23:22
I think the most intimidating villain in the movie was Charlize Theron's bowl cut,2021-06-25 04:46:46
"Tez: we'll be alright as long as we obey the laws of physics

The ENTIRE movie: lol naw, fuck that",2021-06-25 02:46:44
I wish Dom would interact more with the rest of the crew. I felt like we hardly saw him have a scene or interaction with Tej and Roman.,2021-06-25 02:29:29
Can anybody explain to me how Dom gains super strength to the point that he can take on 20 something soldiers single handedly.,2021-06-25 05:19:48
"The one scene I can't get over in the whole movie is when that dude offers Dom a beer.  Dom takes the beer, doesn't take a sip, and just sets it down and leaves.  

why take a beer if you're not going to drink it? just say no thanks.  Now that beer is going to get warm and you can't put it back in the fridge. Its going to take some time for me to process that scene.",2021-06-26 04:07:19
"Somebody lied on the police report... He did not beat a man half to death with a socket wrench.

That was clearly a pipe wrench.",2021-06-25 03:07:16
"i walked out feeling like this was the most ridiculous movie ever made, and whether that's a good thing or a bad thing depends on which scene we're talking about...",2021-06-25 02:30:41
"Holy shit. F&F(at least since Fast 5) were always ridiculous story and physics wise but we hit another level with this.

Also, just how many innocent people Dom and his gang killed with those magnets??? Cars going through entire buildings full of people, utensils (forks, knives, etc.) flying over at the speed of sound, using people's car to stop the armored truck, etc.

At LEAST a hundred. Seems like they were the real bad guys here.

I have to admit tho, that last scene where we ""see"" Brian arriving in his car.... Dom smiling at him offscreen... I felt that.",2021-06-25 19:52:08
Roman is starting to become immune to these Fast & Furious Cabin in the Woods scenarios.,2021-06-25 02:38:53
"If you’ve ever wondered how magnets work, this is the movie for you",2021-06-25 02:04:34
Hear me out. John Cena isn’t part of the family at least not yet. You’re not in the family unless you get to go to the BBQ and share a Corona,2021-06-25 15:01:37
"Was anyone else waiting for Dom to apologize to Jacob ? I mean you basically excluded the guy from your life and any real sense of warmth, letting him stew in anger and hatred for the best part of his life, all because you made an incorrect assumption.",2021-06-25 16:53:05
Calling it now—Han showed up to give Shaw a hug. There is no bad blood between them except maybe Shaw owing Han a 10-second car.,2021-06-25 05:57:49
My favorite part was the bad guy wearing a parachute in the truck for some reason.,2021-06-26 04:06:47
"So here’s the thing with F9. There are so many holes you could poke in it if you wanted to. The fact that, at 9 films in, a bunch of street racers are now taking on Avengers level threats and going INTO SPACE. (My favourite part being that the Tokyo Drift crew are the ones driving the jet that gets them there, who saw that coming in 2006?!). The plot exists as a basic exercise in getting from set piece A to set piece B with a few detours for cameos (I have no idea what Cardi B is doing here but whatever, I’m down!). The sheer, unending ridiculouslness of it all; realistically we jumped the shark in Fast 6 and have been riding the wave ever higher since that moment.

And I don’t give a damn about any of it, cos I had a big stupid grin on my face the entire movie. I don’t know how I’m going to feel about it in 3 watches at home time, but I had a good goddam time at the cinema yesterday.

I still miss Paul Walker - he was the grounding element for the movies, and I suspect behind the scenes too - but it’s good to have Justin Lin back. Not only does he know how to put an action scene together and really bring you along with it (the climactic action scene was way more engaging than 95% of big blockbuster climaxes), he also clearly gets how ridiculous it all is. I laughed like a loon with several action beats, but I was always laughing WITH the movie, not AT it.",2021-06-26 10:49:31
"I really liked the flashback scenes, cool to see young dom. I wonder if they ever make any prequels and go back to the street racimg",2021-06-25 02:44:30
I can’t believe they actually went to space. They finally did it,2021-06-25 02:10:24
"I started bawling when Lucas saw Han again, and gave him that hug. 15 years in the making, fuck everyone got older, and bow wow gain a bit of pounds. Also love that the Tokyo Drift gang got to sit in the table and are now apart of la familia. God, this is a cheesy series but I love it.",2021-06-25 06:28:21
I bet Dom's father winds up being the villain in the next film or the final one. Somehow he'll have been masterminding everything that happened in the entire series.,2021-06-25 06:00:37
I legitimately spent the first hour or so of this movie concerned Dom had straight up abandoned his child,2021-06-25 09:07:38
John Cena staring longidly from his cell got many laughs,2021-06-25 02:37:54
Dom is literally The Hulk without green skin at this point,2021-06-25 02:05:20
The empty plate hit hard but seeing his car hit harder,2021-06-25 02:33:23
"I wonder if the electronic voice from Hobbs and Shaw who was controlling Brixton is somehow connected to Cipher and in 10 and 11, everybody from Hobbs and Shaw and the Fast and Furious films has to come together to defeat them full on Avengers style. Maybe even Brixton will come back re engineered as a good guy because Mr Nobody somehow found a way to fake his death too.",2021-06-25 03:50:43
My biggest problem with these movies is how much they need to stroke VIn's ego during the movie.,2021-06-26 17:11:37
"I love that they didn't actually bother to explain Han's ""death"". ""idk, Mr Nobody did a thing"". Perfect.",2021-06-25 03:12:30
John Cena is such a babyface that he couldn't even be a heel for the entirety of one movie,2021-06-25 02:33:47
I cannot wait for the 'How did this get made?' Podcast episode on this.,2021-06-25 03:30:15
Did they just erase Scott Eastwood’s character from existence?,2021-06-25 20:42:17
They look like minions.,2021-06-25 03:49:24
The best part is young Vin is like 2 feet taller than young Cena.,2021-06-25 02:19:49
Got literal chills when they showed Brian's car at the end. Such a nice touch,2021-06-25 02:52:31
"Let’s see if we can list all the *wait, what?* moments in F9. Not just the obvious ones but those easy to overlook. For example: how did they secure air transport and then get high performance vehicles to the middle of the Central American jungle?",2021-06-25 03:05:30
"So I spend most of the film waiting for the rich dudes dad to be some glorious cameo…

Nope.",2021-06-25 02:04:50

"Having Dame Helen Mirren play a recurring character in this dumb action franchise is the funniest fucking thing to me. 

She is obviously having an absolute ball and its so fun to watch.",2021-06-26 02:24:11

"The power Sung Kang has over this franchise is unreal. First they restructure their entire chronology in order to be able to keep bringing him back, and when that runs its course, they decide screw it, let's just make him alive again anyway. Not bad for what should've been a one-time character.",2021-06-25 09:37:57
I liked the part where they were fast and furious.,2021-06-25 03:44:55
"They actually did it.

They actually sent cars to space in this franchise.

Fast10 your seatbelts, motherfuckers, the sky is the limit from here.

Edit: I just want them to go all in and put literally anything and everything they can think of on the table. Time travel, dinosaurs, the Marina Trench, volcanoes, cheetahs, murder mysteries, Transformers, anime girls, boats, Yoda, I don't care - just put it in a fucking Fast & Furious movie.",2021-06-25 02:09:26
"Cena with the face turn in the end and Ludacris quoting Scott Steiner by saying “THE NUMBERS DON’T LIE!” in space. 

Man, also Brian’s car showing up in the end just felt right.",2021-06-25 03:09:56
Was it me or were they constantly building up Roman and Tej to die?,2021-06-25 02:02:47
How is Dom capable of literally everything except delivering his lines with any ounce of emotion,2021-06-26 23:57:07
"I don't know if it was just the post-pandemic thing, but the theater had a great vibe, everyone was happy-watching.",2021-06-25 04:52:11

Charlize Theron is fine as fuck,2021-06-27 00:07:53
"I left the theater with mixed emotions. This one didn't feel as fun as the other 8. There were a lot of entertaining moments, sure, but something felt off to me.  
It seemed like Dom only interacted with Letty, Jakob, Mia, and (very briefly) Han. Some of the meta commentary was funny but got old quick. The Star Wars bit got such a giant eyeroll from me.   
When Paul Walker died I felt his absence was very noticeable. Now that The Rock and Jason Statham aren't in these movies there's an even bigger hole not being filled.  
The three villains weren't very compelling, or honestly interesting. I much preferred the plot and villainy of 8 to this one.  
I enjoyed Dom and Jakobs backstory, even if the casting felt slightly wonky.  
I'd say Roman and Tej were the saving grace of this movie. Their chemistry and interactions were better in this movie than any of the others.  
I love rewatching these movies but at this moment I don't know if I can rewatch this one.",2021-06-25 02:41:40
"I had a fun time, but it really showed how much Johnson's presence helped the ensemble after Walker's death. Vin just cannot carry an ensemble by himself as the lead. And while we know Mr Nobody is not dead, some sort of tease to where he is would have been nice.",2021-06-25 23:20:34
"This made me rethink what I initially thought of Hobbs and Shaw and actually changed my mind to liking it. At least in those movies, the two main characters are trained super soldiers, not just a bunch of car enthusiasts/petty thieves who are now the Avengers.",2021-06-26 17:04:20
"Ok, I've posted in here before, but here are my final thoughts:

I'm 100% certain the whole cast is in on the ""wink-wink"" nature of these movies...except Vin Diesel

This movie has nods to time travel and immortality...just do it already, you cowards!

Dom has literally forgiven straight-up villains before he forgave his brother, which is absolutely hilarious considering this is all about **family**",2021-06-28 11:53:49
They drive a car through space,2021-06-25 02:11:26
"Just got back from a fairly packed theatre. 

I actually enjoyed the flashback scenes from young dom and the racetrack. There was definitely some emotion build up there. 

The rest of the movie was dumb as hell. The magnets. The outer space. 

The skyline BBQ scene was nice and I’m glad they still included a Paul walked tribute there. 

The reunion from the Tokyo drift cast was nice. As mentioned, Bow wow got fat and Lucas got skinny. Both didn’t age well. 

Most of the theatre left and missed the end credit scene. Did not expect statham to appear in this at all. Theron is still around. Cena is still around. Clearly there is going to be way more movies in this series.",2021-06-25 03:02:29
Tyrese Gibson absolutely earned that paycheck and then some especially in Fast and Furious movies - This one is no exception.,2021-06-27 03:09:03
"Vin Diesel and Helen Mirren have a surprising, almost upsetting amount of sexual chemistry",2021-06-26 02:32:36
"My theory is that Dom didn't survive the crash at the end of the first movie and as his life leaves his battered body a fantasy of being a spy flashes in front of his eyes—and like in Inception, he goes deeper and deeper into this dream of his, and each level is a new F&F movie.

&#x200B;

I really want to believe that, otherwise this movie makes no sense at all.",2021-07-16 15:41:42
"The mad lads did it. Now we wait for time travel, vampires, ghosts, and dinosaurs to enter this series.",2021-06-25 02:08:04
"So hold on. The day Han died, Dom gets a mysterious postcard from Tokyo. He keeps it for years, but never bothers to investigate it? Then in this movie when he sees Cena's cross on the recording, it for some reason reminded him of the postcard so he brings it along, which leads the others to Hans hiding spot eventually?

Basically if Dom had decided to take a trip to Tokyo at any point and roam the streets he could have randomly stumbled across the Mexican flag and reunited with Han?",2021-06-29 06:22:21

Paid for Fast 9 and left having watched a documentary on magnets.,2021-06-27 04:22:03
I hope in subsequent movies they keep showing different angles of Han's car blowing up in Tokyo each one revealing a new retcon for the scene,2021-06-28 21:21:08
So that Cardi B scene? What the hell was that?,2021-06-25 03:45:40
"Say whatever the hell you want about how the action has progressed from ""over the top but somewhat believable"" in Fast Five to ""Alright, I just literally have to suspend common sense to think that worked"" in F9, but the **world building** that has been done over the course of nine (I don't count Hobbs & Shaw) films is only bettered by the Marvel Universe in my opinion.  Yeah, the ""return from death retcon"" trope has been overused way too much, but the little callbacks and details such as remembering characters like Twinky, Leo, Santos and building them into this film or the inclusion of the Shaw family just show a small attention to detail. Hopefully it'll all pay off in the series finale where everyone (What the hell was Don Omar doing where he couldn't show up) who has ever been a part of the ""family"" helps in the final conflict.",2021-06-25 20:05:22

I couldn't stop laughing when Dom speared Jacob on the zip line,2021-06-25 20:43:11
I just absolutely was floored by the fact that the stretched armored truck seemed to move faster upside fucking down than right side up. This movie was ridiculous.,2021-06-26 05:17:01

"First movie post pandemic with friends of mine. Had to be opening night and the moment Han showed up, people clapped. This is what I’ve missed. Yeah theaters are expensive as hell still, and yeah the fast saga isn’t some glorious masterpiece of a franchise. But it is fun, it was funny, stupid, outrageous & we loved every second. Just getting to laugh and enjoy a movie in public was awesome

Now I wanna see The Rock, Idris Elba, Jason Statham and Ryan Reynolds return in Fast10",2021-06-25 03:19:49
"When Mia shows up, Letty says ""Brian is watching the kids"" and there is a cut to Vin Diesel doing a surprise Pikachu face. I laughed for three goddamn minutes straight. Motherfucker, Letty left the farm before you, where did YOU put your son?!",2021-06-26 03:25:44
Best comedy of the year.,2021-06-25 04:07:18
"this was one of the dumbest movies I've seen, but I still loved it solely because of the set pieces and characters and the chemistry they've developed over the past 20 years. 

like if you wrote out the plot of the movie ""yeah there's a super weapon that can take over all computers on the planet and its being hunted by Dom's brother who we've never mentioned over 8 previous installments and also Dom's brother was trying to kill Han who was actually working for the CIA so Shaw faked his murder so that Han could protect the daughter of the scientists because only she can activate said super weapon"" then any reasonable person would be like ""what the fuck?"" things in this movie happen because they happen? Like Dom magically realizes the necklace is his brother's in like a split second clip, they magically show up at every place they're supposed to, Cardi B shows up even though Dom didn't realize where the villain's base was, etc.

but none of that matters because the family is just so entertaining together and the dumb shit that happens is so entertaining. Loved Tej and Roman and Ramsey in this one, felt like they got a lot to do, excited to see Han in the next Hobbs and Shaw movie, and stoked to see more of these guys' adventures",2021-06-25 02:15:45
"When Jacob pressed the NOS in the race, I said in my head ""Too soon, junior"", and then Dom said ""Too soon"". I love that a tiny throwaway line from (I think) 2Fast2Furious made it in this movie!

"Magnetism: The movie 

Lmao my mom and I were dying at just how ridiculous this shit has got, mfs going to space in cars, destroying satellites, crossing mountains with bridge ropes 😂 but fuck it, we’ll keep watching em

Loved that Jacob and Dom made up at the end, I can’t imagine how hard it was for Jacob to be blamed and hated and he only did what his father asked. A good son. Wish they would’ve had a proper hug at the end, but for Dom, that car is worth so much to him so that was worth way more

Nice set up for Hobbs and Shaw 2 as well as Fast 10",2021-06-26 00:46:59
I feel like “Dom & Letty try to adjust to civilian life as parents but his criminal brother shows up” and “Cipher has a super weapon and they go to space” are two completely different scripts that vin diesel Vegas shuffled into one movie,2021-06-27 13:28:13
"There’s a very small bit at the beginning I can’t stop thinking about where Dom is with baby Brian and the kid says something to the effect of, out of nowhere, “do you know where God is? They say God lives in your heart” to which Dom says like “oh yeah? Well I’ll live forever in your heart” 

Which like, this kids probably interacted with max 4 other people since he could walk and talk or whatever, where did he hear this from. Who’s giving baby Brian the scoop here",2021-06-27 17:17:40
"Honestly the most disappointing part of the movie was the reunion of Sean and Han. It was super weak, honestly Han's entire resurrection was weak. Even though they went to space this movie still felt tamer than the past few. Loved the flashbacks though.",2021-06-25 05:19:13

Dom breaking Lety's fall with his car.

Making a spacecraft from a Fiero that definitely already blew up at an earlier point. (Not discounting the possibility of an endless supply of red Fieros.)

Why did I still enjoy this movie? 6/10",2021-06-25 06:48:10
"I wouldn't call this the worst movie I have seen but I would say this is by far the stupidest movie I have seen. There's not a single scene in the movie that makes an ounce of sense.  
That said, there was a moment they could've turned this from a bad movie to a classic. When they tried to stop the moving truck at last part of the movie and it seemed impossible to do but then John Cena's character came in and save the day. If...at that moment, they would put on Cena's WWE entrance music and he comes out with green hat and purple arm band. This would place this movie in my top 10 of all time.",2021-07-06 18:54:58

"Things that made me laugh


- Serious Vin
- Young Dom looking like Barack
- Vin's Blue Steel pout
- Vin being in separate shots from other characters in the scenes, probably because he needed a hundred takes per line
- Han's perpetual snacking to make up for his lack of character
- demoting Sean the stoic, cool Tokyo drifter to a bumbling goof
- God Mode Tyrese
- the tacky TikTok style subtitles",2021-07-29 21:23:02

"What a ridiculous but amazing movie.

Roman going full meta commentary, Dom turning into Sampson, and Han's crash getting another ret-con.

I love the franchise, but this one felt like they're coming to the end of the arc for the main cast. Vin seemed oddly distant from most of the others. The weirdly long dying dream scene and Dom's even more than usual dramatic staring while thinking scenes felt like it was building to a finale for him. Cypher remaining a villain for multiple movies feels like defeating her will be Dom's last hurrah.

This should lead to a spinoff that's just three hours of Tyrese riffing on things happening to him.

Also, big credit to Sung Kang. Han clearly seemed effected by all that he's dealt with and felt like a really changed man.",2021-06-25 03:39:18
"Much more enjoyable than 8 imo. By far the most preposterous stunts of the whole franchise, culminating with the space travel which had my theater laughing harder than most comedies. I liked the meta commentary by the characters, most obviously Roman thinking they’re invincible, but also little lines like “Well that’s a new one” from Letty. 

Cena was fine in the “adversary who’s clearly gonna team up with the gang” role, but man I miss The Rock. Holding out hope that they bring him back at some point. 

I liked the flashbacks more than I thought I would. Young Dom didn’t look much like Diesel, but the voice was pretty spot-on. Would have never thought to cast Finn Cole as a young John Cena, but they do sort of look alike except for the drastic height difference. Loved briefly seeing young versions of Letty, Vince and Jesse. I wouldn’t be surprised if they do a prequel in that time period at some point.

On the Fast scale, if Fast Five is 10/10, this is a solid 8.5. Great to see Justin Lin come back and embrace the absurdity of this franchise. Can’t wait for 10!",2021-06-25 02:52:43

"F10&11 are gonna get the Infinity War/Endgame treatment. We are gonna get about 6 hours of family fun in the near future.

It’s obvious that Charlize Theron’s character is gonna pull a Dr Evil and get a satellite that will pull in an asteroid to destroy the world and the family will be forced into more space fun in the 10th movie. Probably will get stuck on the asteroid and someone will have to sacrifice theirselves on the asteroid with a makeshift NOS Bomb (Tyrese Gibson). This will leave the family in disarray and defeated for movie 11 where they finally kill Theron.

Which will set up the prequel movies.",2021-06-26 10:42:18
"I got many problems with the plot. Doms brother is a big time spy/evil guy yet no one mentions him in the previous movies, he also never acknowledges the sister till the end, also he thinks a lie about his father match fixing is worth moving away from your hometown and letting your brother think you killed their father.  

Leti just decides she is going on the mission the same night they hear about it barely telling Dom she is leaving.

Also the magnets don't work on their own cars. 

Dom apparently sacrificing his life (which entails shutting a door that he could have just entered himself and helped protect the team escape) to fight 30 guys hand to hand combat with Samson strength, then is saved from drowning by said wife he was trying to protect. 

Dom's jumps off bridge with a car, hooks tire to rope and swings across a cliff and all this is not by accident, Roman mention Cena's plane magnet swoop but not Dom's tire rope swing across bridge stunt.

Leti seeing Mexican flag on random house in Japan and connecting dots immediately that this is Hans house some 3 years later or so.

The explanation for how they faked Han's death was literally 'magic'. One moment he is in the burning car next moment he is in the building standing next to Mr. Nobody. This one somehow bothered me the most because that means no character can leave really, since they can all be brought back by magic as an explanation. 

Also Mr. Nobody's name is very stupid, especially since they use it so many times. Mr. Nobody also telling Han he recruited Gisele to work for him and she was his best student, even though she was working with the cartel before she met Doms crew. 

Also weird rich criminal kid guy releasing Cipher as if she won't immediatelty double cross him. 

Also having Francis Nganou not really fighting anyone and winning. 

Cardi B was okay and actually funny but the whole interpol scene arresting Dom in the mansion was dumb.

The big weapon dome thing being controlled by whether the kid touches it was pretty dumb.

Space scene was fine since they were the ones who took all the risk and actually stopped the satellite.

 Dom living in the wilderness was dumb, since now he is back to LA rebuilding the house.

The backstory for why Brian is not helping while Mia helps is weird. I mean the initial reason was they were raising the family together and don't want to put the family at risk. It isn't good and doesn't hold up since they keep refering to him knowing he can't show up

Also Dom doesn't have any jokes or banter with other members of the crew. They don't even mention Hobbs.",2021-07-04 20:50:01
